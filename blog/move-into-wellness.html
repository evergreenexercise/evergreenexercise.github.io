        <h1>Move Into Wellness</h1>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Our bodies are made to move. The human body is an amazingly complex system and it
          functions best on all levels when itâ€™s active.  It is vitally important that our lifestyle
          includes plenty of physical activity for our bodies to work well and stay healthy. Exercise
          should support our skeletal structure and enhance optimal movement patterns but unfortunately many
          exercise programs will have you straining and punishing your body in ways that undermine optimal
          health. I focus on postural alignment, joint mobility and movement patterning exercises to
          build a solid foundation of movement proficiency before adding loads and higher intensities.
          Not only is this a gentle, safe and enjoyable way for anybody to begin an exercise practice, it is
          also the most effective and efficient way to progress and enhance function and performance over the long term.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I work with clients, I focus on quality of movement and utilise the science of behaviour
          change to help people establish new movement habits that can be sustained over the long term.
          Rather than adding periods of intense exercise to a sedentary lifestyle, I advocate establishing
          a daily movement practice as the first step to increasing health and wellness. Once a baseline of
          healthy movement is established, the intensity of physical activity can be increased gradually so
          that it is safe, sustainable, effective and enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The human body has the ability to renew and rejuvenate itself and maintains an amazing capacity
          to respond positively to exercise stimulus well into old age. This capacity for renewal needs to
          be supported by adopting healthy lifestyles that include optimal nutrition, sleep, sunshine, stress
          and movement.  While it is true that any movement compared to sitting on the couch will provide
          positive results in the short term, before long poor movement patterns will start to cause discomfort
          and pain as the joints, tendons and muscles are placed under inappropriate loads and strains.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to move more often with less pain and discomfort, good movement patterns need to be established
          before building strength and endurance. By learning how to get back in touch with your body, how to be
          more mindful about the quality of your movements within a structured exercise program, it becomes second
          nature to move with more grace and power while engaging in a range of day to day activities.
        </p>
