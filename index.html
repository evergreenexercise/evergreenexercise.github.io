<hr>
<br>
<p>I am an accredited exercise physiologist and the founder of Evergreen Exercise Physiology.
Adopting lifestyle choices that optimise health and wellness has been an enduring interest of
mine and I am passionate about promoting the concept of thriving, not simply surviving.
Having graduated with honours in Clinical Exercise Physiology from the Queensland
University of Technology, I am qualified to prescribe exercise programmes based on my
tertiary training in the disciplines of anatomy, physiology, motor control, psychology, and
biomechanics. The knowledge and skills I acquired from my studies enable me to prescribe
and deliver effective, evidence based exercise programs for functional conditioning and
chronic disease management for a wide range of clients. I have a particular interest in
supporting healthy aging and in working with clients with musculoskeletal conditions and
dysfunctions.</p>

<p>My approach to exercise prescription is strongly influenced by the study of biomechanics Â­ in
particular the influence that physical forces have on our bodies at the cellular level and the
power of mechanotransduction in shaping our bodies. While the science may be complex, I
promote natural human movement using simple methods that increase body awareness and
improve movement patterns which over time will lead to increased mobility, better bone and
joint health, increased body density, reduced pain, and improved metabolic health.</p>

<p> My exercise prescriptions are designed to support the natural function of the body, and to help
develop strength and mobility to assist individuals regain their health and to improve their
ability to perform activities of daily living with ease and grace. I am passionate about sharing
practical ideas and employing the science of behaviour change to help people form new
movement habits, and to take control of regaining their health and wellbeing.</p>
